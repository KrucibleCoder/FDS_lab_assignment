Q.1] In a SE computer engineering class, group A students play cricket, group B students play badmenton and group C students play football. 
Write a python program using functions to compute the following: 
1] List of students who play both cricket and badmenton. 
2] List of students who play cricket and badmenton or both the games. 
3] List of students who play either cricket or badmenton but not both. 
4] Number of students who play neither cricket not badmenton. 
5] Number of students who play cricket and football but not badmenton.
