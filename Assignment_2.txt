'''
Q.1] Write a python program to store marks stored in subject FDS by n number of students in the class.
Write functions to compute the following :
1] The average score of the class.
2] The highest score and the lowest score of the class.
3] Count of students who were absent for the test.
4] Display the marks with highest frequency.
